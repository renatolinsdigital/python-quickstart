# Python quickstart - Essential notes by Renato Lins

Python was initially created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 with the intention of creating a language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Over the years, Python has grown to become one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, utilized in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

### 1. Considerations - Why to learn Python

Ps. If you're new to Python and looking for a coding environment, consider using __pythononlinecompiler.com__ or __trinket.io__ to write and execute Python code interactively. These platforms offer a convenient way to experiment with Python syntax and observe the output of your code.

### 2. Variables:

A variable is a named storage location in your computer's memory. Think of it as a labeled box where you can store and retrieve information. You create a variable in Python by simply assigning a value to a name.

```python
# Example of declaring a variable and assigning a text value
message = "Hello, Python!"

# Example of declaring and assigning a variable with numerical value
number = 42
```

Python does not have built-in support for constants in the same way that some other programming languages do (such as Java or C++). However, it does have conventions to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant.

```python
# Example of declaring a constant variable
PI = 3.14
```

### 3. Variables and essential data types in Python:

Variables in Python are containers that store data values. They allow you to assign names to values, making it easier to reference and manipulate data in your code. Python supports several types of variables, each serving a different purpose. So we have commonly used data types such as:

__String:__ Represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"
```

__Integer and Float:__ Represents numerical values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

```python
age = 25
```

__Boolean:__ Represents either True or False, often used for logical operations.

```python
is_coding_fun = True
```

__List:__ Represents a sequentially ordered collection of values.

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print(colors[0])  # Output: red
```

__Dictionary:__ Represents a collection of key-value pairs.

```python
person = {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "is_student": False
}
```

Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type is inferred based on the assigned value. This allows for flexibility and simplicity in variable declaration.

NOTE: In Python, lists are fundamental data structures representing ordered and mutable sequences of elements, created using square brackets `[]`. They allow duplicates and are widely used for storing and manipulating collections of items. On the other hand, 'collections' refer to a broader category of data structures beyond lists. This category includes tuples, dictionaries, sets, and the collections module, offering specialized data structures. These collections may offer additional functionality and optimizations tailored to specific use cases. However, understanding collections in depth is not within the scope of this tutorial.

### 4. Operators:

Operators in Python are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They enable you to create expressions, combining and manipulating data. Let's explore some fundamental operators with code examples:

__Assignment Operator (=):__ Assigns a value to a variable (as seen previously).

```python
my_value = 10
```

__Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %):__ Perform basic mathematical operations.

```python
sum = 5 + 3       # Calculate sum: 5 + 3 = 8
difference = 7 - 2  # Calculate difference: 7 - 2 = 5
product = 4 * 6     # Calculate product: 4 * 6 = 24
quotient = 10 / 2   # Calculate quotient: 10 / 2 = 5
remainder = 15 % 4  # Calculate remainder: 15 % 4 = 3
```

__Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=):__ Compare values and return a Boolean result.

```python
is_equal = (5 == '5')   # True, values are equal
is_not_equal = (10 != '10')   # False, values are not equal
is_greater_than = (15 > 10)   # True, 15 is greater than 10
is_less_than = (5 < 8)        # True, 5 is less than 8
is_greater_or_equal = (20 >= 20)  # True, 20 is equal to 20
is_less_or_equal = (30 <= 25)     # False, 30 is not less than or equal to 25
```

__Logical Operators (and, or, not):__ Combine multiple conditions and perform logical comparisons.

```python
is_true = (True and False)   # False
is_either_true = (True or False)  # True
is_not_true = not True   # False
```

__Unary Operators (++, --):__ Increment or decrement a variable by 1.

```python
counter = 5
counter += 1   # Increment by 1
counter -= 1   # Decrement by 1
```

__String Concatenation Operator (+):__ Concatenates two or more strings.

```python
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name   # 'John Doe'
```

NOTE: F-strings, or formatted strings, offer a convenient way to include variables and expressions within string literals. They are often used to express the result of operations. Example:

```python
# Define variables
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
age = 30

# Using f-strings for string concatenation
full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"  # 'John Doe'
greeting = f"Hello, {first_name}!"       # 'Hello, John!'
profile = f"Name: {full_name}, Age: {age}"  # 'Name: John Doe, Age: 30'
```

### 5. Control Flow in Python - 'if' Statement

In Python, the `if` statement is used to conditionally execute a block of code. It allows you to specify a condition, and if that condition evaluates to true, the code inside the `if` block will be executed. If the condition is false, the code inside the if block will be skipped. Let's look at a simple example:

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 20:
    print("It's a warm day!")
```

In this example, if the temperature variable is greater than 20, the message "It's a warm day!" will be printed. You can also use an else statement to specify a block of code that will be executed if the condition in the `if` statement is `False`:

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 20:
    print("It's a warm day!")
else:
    print("It's a cool day.")
```

In this case, if the temperature is not greater than 20, the message "It's a cool day." will be printed. You can also chain multiple conditions using `elif`:

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a warm day!")
else:
    print("It's a cool day.")
```

Here, if the temperature is greater than 30, the message "It's a hot day!" will be printed. If the temperature is not greater than 30 but is greater than 20, the message "It's a warm day!" will be printed. Otherwise, the message "It's a cool day." will be printed.

These are basic examples, and `if` statements can become more complex with logical operators and other Python features.

Python has a ternary operator, often referred to as a conditional expression. It follows the syntax: `x if condition else y`. Let's see:

```python
# Define variables
temperature = 25
weather_is_nice = True
message_to_display = ""

# Ternary operator
message_to_display = "Go for a walk!" if weather_is_nice else "Stay indoors."

# Output the result
print(message_to_display)  # Output will be "Go for a walk!" if weather is nice, otherwise "Stay indoors."
```

You can also chain multiple ternary operators together to mimic else if behavior. For example:

```python
result = "A" if score >= 90 else "B" if score >= 80 else "C" if score >= 70 else "D" if score >= 60 else "F"
```

However, chaining too many ternary operators like this can reduce readability. In some cases, using if statements or refactoring the code might lead to clearer and more maintainable code.

__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, such as those within conditions or functions. It's a crucial part of Python syntax for structuring code and determining the scope of what will be executed. The standard convention is to use four spaces for each level of indentation. Here's a brief example:

```python
if condition:
    print("This code is inside the if block.")
    print("This code is also inside the if block.")
print("This code is outside the if block.")
```

If you don't follow the indentation rules in Python, you'll encounter indentation errors. These errors indicate that Python was unable to parse your code properly because the indentation does not match the expected structure. For instance, if you mix tabs and spaces for indentation or if you have inconsistent indentation levels within the same block, Python will raise an `IndentationError`:

```python
if condition:
    print("This code is inside the if block.")
  print("This code is incorrectly indented.")  
  # The line above has an extra space at the beginning, it will raise an IndentationError
```

### 6. Control Flow II - Falsy and Truthy Values

In Python, values can be broadly categorized into two groups: truthy and falsy.

__Truthy Values:__ A value is truthy if, when used in a condition (like in an `if` statement), it's treated as `True`. For example, any non-empty string, any number other than 0, `True` itself, or any non-empty object is truthy.

__Falsy Values:__ A value is falsy if, in a condition, it's treated as `False`. Examples include `False` itself, the number 0, an empty string (`""`), `None`, and `NaN` (which stands for Not a Number). Example:

```python
if "Hello":
  # This code will run because "Hello" is truthy
  print("Truthy!")

if 0:
  # This code won't run because 0 is falsy
  print("Falsy!")
```

__Default value:__ The 'default value' or 'fallback pattern' is a common practice in Python for assigning a value to a variable if the intended value might be falsy. This pattern often involves using the logical OR (`or`) operator. Here's an example to illustrate the concept:

```python
my_var = "Hello, World!"
message = my_var or "Default Value"

print(message)  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

### 7. Control flow III - Loops

Loops provide a convenient means to execute a block of code repeatedly for each item in the sequence. Let's check a couple of common ways of establishing loop iterations in Python.

__'for' loop:__ The `for` loop in Python is a control flow statement used to iterate over a sequence of elements. It's commonly used when you need to perform the same operation on each element of a list, tuple, string, dictionary, set, range, or any other iterable object. Let's see a couple of use cases:

* When we know the range of value in advance

```python
# Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Regarding `range()`: In the example above, the function call creates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 (inclusive) up to 6 (exclusive). So, it generates the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It's important to note that range() generates numbers up to, but not including, the second argument.

If you want to start from 0, you can simply use range(`<number>`) because `range()` starts from 0 by default:

```python
# Using range to iterate from 0 to 9
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

* Lists

 ```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num) # Prints 1 to 5
```

* Strings

 ```python
message = "Hello"
for char in message:
    print(char) # Prints each letter
```

* Dictionaries

```python
# Define a dictionary representing information about a person
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Iterate over the keys of the dictionary and print each key
for key in person:
    print(key)

# Iterate over the values of the dictionary and print each value
for value in person.values():
    print(value)

# Iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary and print each pair
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, ":", value)
```

__'while' loop:__ The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues as long as a specified condition is `True`.

```python
# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

__Loop control statements:__ Python provides loop control statements like `break` and `continue` to alter the flow of a loop.

```python
# Example 1: Use break to exit a loop early
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when i is 5
    print(i)  # Shows 1 to 4

# Example 2: Use continue to skip the current iteration
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip the iteration when i is 3
    print(i)  # Shows 1 to 5 excluding 3
```

__IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION:__ Loops are one of the most frequently used features in any programming language, and Python provides these and other ways to loop through values. Having a good understanding of loops (in any language) is never a 'time wasted,' considering how often they are used.

### 8. Control flow IV - match-case statements

The `match-case` statement in Python makes value evaluation straightforward. Unlike some languages, Python avoids the `switch-case` structure in favor of clear and readable `if-elif-else` statements. Yet, managing many conditions with `if-elif-else` can get hard to maintain. That's where Python's answer comes in: the `match-case` statement introduced in __Python 3.10__. Let's see how it workd by the following example:

```python
number = 5

# Using the match-case statement to evaluate 'number'
match number:
    # Check if 'number' is greater than 0
    case n if n > 0:
        print(f"{number} is a positive number.")
    # Check if 'number' is less than 0
    case n if n < 0:
        print(f"{number} is a negative number.")
    # Default case if 'number' is zero or any other value
    case _:
        print(f"{number} is zero.")
```

Each case block specifies a pattern to match against the expression being evaluated. The underscore (`_`) pattern serves as a wildcard, matching any value not covered by preceding case blocks. This makes it a common practice to use `_` as the final case block to provide a default or 'catch-all' response for unmatched values. 

NOTE: In the `match-case` statement, the variable `n` represents the matched value of the expression being evaluated. While it's possible to use `number` instead, shorter variable names are commonly used for brevity and clarity. They make the code more concise and readable, especially within the context of pattern matching, where the focus is on the pattern rather than the variable name. Shorter variable names are preferred to avoid cluttering the code with longer names.

If for some reason you are coding in an older version of Python, the same result can be achieved in two different ways:

1) Using `if-elif-else`:

```python
number = 5

# Check if 'number' is greater than 0
if number > 0:
    print(f"{number} is a positive number.")
# Check if 'number' is less than 0
elif number < 0:
    print(f"{number} is a negative number.")
# Default case if 'number' is zero or any other value
else:
    print(f"{number} is zero.")
```

2) Utilizing dictionaries, lambda functions, and a mapping function for associating conditions with corresponding actions (slightly more verbose, yet effective):

```python
number = 5

# Define a dictionary where keys are lambda functions and values are corresponding messages
number_cases = {
    lambda n: n > 0: lambda number: print(f"{number} is a positive number."),
    lambda n: n < 0: lambda number: print(f"{number} is a negative number."),
    lambda n: True: lambda number: print(f"{number} is zero.")
}

# Function to match the number based on defined cases
def match_number(number):
    for condition, action in number_cases.items():
        if condition(number):
            action(number)
            break

# Test the function with different numbers
match_number(5)  # Output: 5 is a positive number.
match_number(-3) # Output: -3 is a negative number.
match_number(0)  # Output: 0 is zero.
```

Both functions and lambda functions will be covered next.

__Performance considerations:__ In overall performance, the `match-case` statement and `if-elif-else` statements tend to be better optimized and more efficient compared to the approach using dictionaries, lambda functions, and a mapping function. However, the differences in performance between these approaches are generally minimal for most applications, and other factors such as readability, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices should also be considered when choosing the most suitable approach for a specific scenario.

### 9. Basics of functions

In Python, functions are blocks of reusable code that can be defined and called upon to perform specific tasks. They play a crucial role in organizing and structuring code, promoting reusability, and enhancing maintainability. There are two common ways to define functions in Python: function definitions and lambda functions.

__Function Definitions__: A function definition is a way to define a function with the def keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a block of code indented below.

```python
# Defining the function
def add(x, y):
    # Calculating the sum of x and y
    sum_value = x + y
    
    # Returning the calculated sum
    return sum_value

# Calling the function and storing the returned value
my_sum = add(3, 7)

# Displaying the result
print(my_sum) # Output: 10
```

In this example:

`add` is the function name.
`(x, y)` are the parameters that represent the data the function receives when called.
`sum_value = x + y` represents the function body, where the actual code is executed.
`return sum_value` is the result returned after the code is executed.

__Lambda Functions__: Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a way to define small, unnamed functions using the lambda keyword. They are commonly used for short, one-liner functions.

```python
# Defining a lambda function for subtracting two numbers
subtract = lambda x, y: x - y

# Calling the lambda function and storing the returned value
my_subtract = subtract(7, 3)

# Displaying the result
print(my_subtract) # Output: 4
```

In this example:

The `lambda` keyword is used to define the lambda function.
`x` and `y` are the parameters.
`x - y` represents the expression that calculates the result.
`:` separates the parameters from the expression. In lambda functions, the result of evaluating the expression after the colon is automatically returned as the result of the function.

Both function definitions and lambda functions serve similar purposes but are used in different contexts. Function definitions are more suitable for complex or multi-line functions, while lambda functions are preferred for short, one-liner functions.

NOTE: Unlike JavaScript, Python does not hoist variable or function declarations. In Python, variables and functions must be explicitly defined before they are used. This means Python does not automatically move declarations to the top of the scope. If you attempt to access a variable or function before it's defined, Python will raise a `NameError`:

```python
# Attempting to access a variable before it's defined
print(my_variable)  # This will raise a NameError

# Defining the variable after the attempt
my_variable = 42
```

### 10. String Manipulation - Essential Techniques and Functions

__Concatenation:__ Concatenation involves merging strings together. Example:

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
```

__Formatted Strings:__ Formatted strings offer a concise way to embed expressions within strings, reducing reliance on concatenation. Example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

greeting_message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

print(greeting_message)  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 30 years old.
```

__.len():__ The `len()` function retrieves the number of characters in a string. Example:

```python
greeting = "Hello, Python!"
length_of_greeting = len(greeting)

print(f"The length of the greeting is {length_of_greeting} characters.")
```

__.strip():__ The `strip()` method eliminates leading and trailing whitespace from a string. Example:

```python
spaced_string = "   Trim me!   "
trimmed_string = spaced_string.strip()

print(f"Original String: \"{spaced_string}\"")
print(f"Trimmed String: \"{trimmed_string}\"")
```

__slicing notation:__ The feature that enables using `[]` to slice a string is known as "slicing notation" or simply "slicing." It allows you to extract a portion of a sequence, like a string, list, or tuple, by specifying a start index, an end index, and an optional step size.

```python
sentence = "This is a sample sentence."

# Extract a substring from index 5 to 10 (excluding 10)
substring = sentence[5:10]

print(f"Substring: {substring}")  # Output: Substring: is a
```

__.upper() and .lower():__ These methods convert strings to uppercase or lowercase, respectively.

```python
# Original mixed-case string
mixed_case = "My teXt MesSage"

# Convert the string to uppercase
upper_case = mixed_case.upper()

# Convert the string to lowercase
lower_case = mixed_case.lower()

# Log the uppercase and lowercase versions to the console
print(f"Uppercase: {upper_case}")
# Output: Uppercase: MY TEXT MESSAGE

print(f"Lowercase: {lower_case}")
# Output: Lowercase: my text message
```

__.replace():__ This method searches for a specified value (searchValue) in a string and replaces it with another value (replaceValue). Example:

```python
string = "Hello, World!"
print(string.replace("World", "Universe"))  # Outputs "Hello, Universe!"
```

In Python, a plethora of string methods, including `.find()`, `.split()`, `.startswith()`, `.endswith()`, and more, are available. Comprehensive references such as the Python documentation or online tutorials offer detailed explanations of each method. 

Ps. For a deeper understanding in string manipulation, consider exploring the Python Language Reference, which provides detailed insights into the language's specifications.

### 11. Common methods for processing iterables

Python provides powerful tools like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for processing iterables efficiently. These methods align with functional programming principles, promoting clarity, immutability, and composability in code. Benefits are:

* Clarity: Expressive operations like mapping and filtering make code easier to understand.
* Immutability: Working with immutable data structures reduces bugs and simplifies debugging.
* Composability: Functions can be combined into pipelines for complex transformations.
* Testability: Stateless functions facilitate unit testing, ensuring code reliability.
* Parallelism: Functional programming supports parallel and concurrent execution, enhancing performance.

By embracing these methods and principles, developers can craft cleaner, more efficient codebases that are easier to maintain and scale. As this tutorial targets beginners, we'll focus solely on the methods `map()` and `filter()`.

__map():__ In Python, the `map()` function can transform any iterable, not just lists. It can operate on tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, and other iterable objects. The function applies a specified function to each item in the iterable and returns an iterator containing the results.

Example: Doubling each element in a list

```python
# Define a function to add 1 to a number
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

# Example: Using map with a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply add_one function to each item in the list using map
mapped_numbers = map(add_one, numbers)

# Convert the mapped_numbers iterator to a list (iterable)
result = list(mapped_numbers)

# Output the result
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

__filter():__ The `filter()` method in Python allows you to selectively filter elements from an iterable based on a specified condition. It takes two arguments: a function that returns a Boolean value (`True` or `False`), and an iterable. The function is applied to each item in the iterable, and only items for which the function returns True are included in the result.

Example: Filtering even numbers from a list

```python
# Define a function to check if a number is even
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

# Example: Using filter with a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Apply is_even function to each item in the list using filter
filtered_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)

# Convert the filtered_numbers iterator to a list (iterable)
result = list(filtered_numbers)

# Output the result
print(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

__Iterables vs. Iterators__: While processing iterables, it's crucial to distinguish between an iterable and an iterator. An iterable, such as a list or string, is anything you can loop over. On the other hand, an iterator is a special object that facilitates looping over an iterable. Iterators provide access to each item in the sequence one at a time. The `next()` function is used to advance the iterator to the next item and return it.

Iterable Example:

```python
# Iterable: List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# You can loop over the list directly
for item in my_list:
    print(item)  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

Iterator Example:

```python
# Iterable: List
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Get an iterator object from the iterable
my_iterator = iter(my_list)

# Use the iterator to get items one at a time
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 1
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 2
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 3
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 4
print(next(my_iterator))  # Output: 5

# After all items are exhausted, next() raises StopIteration
# print(next(my_iterator))  # Uncommenting this line would raise StopIteration
```

As `next()` advances the iterator to the next item and returns that item, we can utilize it to find values within our iterable. Example:

```python
# Create an iterator from a list of numbers
numbers = iter([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# The expression (num for num in numbers if num > 25) is a generator expression 
# that yields numbers from the iterator that are higher than 25

# The next() function retrieves the next item from the generator expression

# If no such number is found, it returns the default value None
found_number = next((num for num in numbers if num > 25), None)

# Print the found number
print(found_number)  # Output: 30
```

Ps. A generator expression is a compact and memory-efficient means of creating iterators in Python. It operates similarly to list comprehensions but generates values lazily, without constructing the entire sequence in memory. This allows for efficient processing of large datasets or infinite sequences, as values are produced on-the-fly as needed. Generator expressions are often used in conjunction with the `iter()` function to create iterators from iterables, enabling seamless integration with other iterator-based operations and enhancing code readability and efficiency.

3. __Running Python files__

With VS Code open, navigate to the desired folder (where your project will be), right-click, and select 'New File'. Name it with a .py extension (e.g., my_script.py). Inside this file, you can write a test code, like the following:

```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
result = num1 + num2
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", result)
```

Once you're in the directory containing your Python file, you can run it by typing `python my_script.py`

4. __Understanding and installing Python packages__

A Python package is a collection of modules, functions, classes, and other resources that can be easily distributed and reused in Python projects. Packages help organize and manage Python code by providing a structured way to group related functionality together. We have official and Non-official Packages:

__Official Packages__: These are packages that are officially maintained and distributed by the Python Software Foundation or other recognized organizations. They undergo rigorous testing and adhere to Python's standards and best practices. Examples include packages like requests, numpy, and matplotlib.

__Non-official Packages__: These are packages developed and maintained by individual developers or third-party organizations. While they may not be officially endorsed by Python, they can still be valuable and widely used in the Python community. Examples include packages like django, flask, and tensorflow.

 Benefits of Installing Packages:

* Code Reusability: Packages provide pre-written code that you can reuse in your projects, saving time and effort in development.

* Enhanced Functionality: Packages often offer specialized functionality that extends Python's core capabilities. For example, packages like requests make it easy to work with HTTP requests, while numpy provides efficient array operations.

* Community Support: Many packages have active communities of developers who contribute improvements, bug fixes, and documentation, providing valuable support for users.

* Increased Productivity: By leveraging existing packages, developers can focus on solving higher-level problems rather than reinventing the wheel for common tasks.

* Ecosystem Growth: Installing and using packages contributes to the growth of Python's ecosystem, fostering innovation and collaboration within the community.

__Installing packages with PIP__: Pip is a package manager for Python that simplifies the process of installing, managing, and uninstalling Python packages. It stands for "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python". It typically comes pre-installed with most Python distributions. Pip is the default and most common way to install Python packages due to its ease of use, large package repository, widespread adoption within the Python community, integration with virtual environments, and active development and maintenance. To check the version of Pip installed on your system, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt: `pip --version`. 

Installing and using a package:

Once PIP is installed, you can use it to install any package from __pypi.org__, the official repository for Python packages. For example, to install __numpy__, use the following command: `pip install numpy`. After installation, you can optionally verify its success by checking the package details.: `pip show numpy`. With the new package installed, we can make use of it as per the example:

```python
# Import the NumPy library and alias it as np
import numpy as np

# Create an array using NumPy's array function
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Print the array
print(my_array)
```
